# Command-Line-Local-Music-Player

Usage:
  1. Set variable PATH in the script to local music directory
  2. Run the script like this: ./play 'Song name'
      <br />e.g. "./play back in black"
  
 The song name entered need not have to have perfect spelling. Even with misspellings the algorithm tries its best to search for the most nearest song name in the directory.
